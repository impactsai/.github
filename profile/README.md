# ImpactsAI
### The platform for trusted Impact Oracles.
We are a community of developers pioneering the next generation of decentralized autonomous agents, using Web3 and Causal AI.  
ImpactsAI is an open platform for researching, building, and deploying Impact Oracles that are designed to sense, evaluate, and respond to real-world changes, take actions, and verify the outcomes.

ImpactsAI provides a suite of tools to build, deploy, and monetize Impact Oracles. Our platform provides the technical infrastructure you need to develop sophisticated Decentralised Autonomous Agents.

## What Are Impact Oracles? ü§ñ
Impact Oracles are AI-driven Decentralised Autonomous Agents operating from secure Web3 infrastructure, to assist with causal decision-making, process automation, and verification of actions that generate real-world impacts.  
Impact Oracles are ownable, verifiable, controllable, explainable, well-governed, accountable, and include humans in the loop.

## Oracle Creators Studio üå±
Unlock the full potential of your Impact Oracle development journey with the ImpactsAI Creator Studio. This intuitive platform is designed to support developers in creating, testing, and deploying Impact Oracles. It provides a rich set of features, including:
- User-friendly visual interface: Easily design and configure your Impact Oracles with drag-and-drop tools.
- Comprehensive code editor: Write, review, and edit your code with syntax highlighting and auto-completion features.
- Robust testing suite: Validate the performance and reliability of your Impact Oracles with various testing tools.
- Easy to use deployment manager: Seamlessly deploy your Impact Oracles to the IXO network with a few clicks.
- Dynamic monitoring dashboard to keep track of your Impact Oracle's performance and make data-driven decisions.
- Collaborative workspace to share your work with others, get feedback, and collaborate on projects.
- Access to a wide range of resources, including libraries of templates, examples, and tutorials to guide your development process.

## Oracle Templates üìê
Accelerate your development process with Oracle templates that cover a variety of use cases, including environmental monitoring, sustainable development, health impact tracking, and more. Each template comes with pre-configured parameters and functions that can be copied, modified or forked, to give you a solid starting point for your Impact Oracle development.

## Infrastructure ü¶ã
Impact Oracles are built on the Internet of Impacts Technology Stack, which features:
- **Causal AI Models:** Transform Theories of Change into executable Causal Models that enable white box, explainable and accountable decisions to be made and outcomes to be verified with data and causal inference.
- **Cognitive Digital Twin Systems:** Bring real-world impact-generating systems into the digital state-space where these can be operated with the assistance of Impact Oracles.
- **Impacts Hub Blockchain:** A purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain based on the IXO Protocols for governing, financing, implementing, and verifying Impacts at an Internet scale.
- **Federated Databases:** Ensure data privacy with end-to-end encryption and the most advanced data-sharing mechanisms, based on the Matrix Protocol.
- **Matrix Protocol Messaging:** Secure communication for decentralised agents.
- **Semantic Data Graphs:** Use ontology-driven data structures together with blockchain sequencing, to build stateful graphs.
- **Interchain Ecosystem:** Seamlessly integrate with the Internet of Blockchains to access the services and data of connected networks.
- **Programmable Protocols:** Automate structured workflows and interactions with third-party services with executable protocols.
- **Event-Driven Payments:** Enable automated payments for services rendered.
- **Digital Identifiers:** Authenticate agents with secure digital IDs and verifiable credentials.
- **Verifiable Claims:** Fuse data pipelines and attestations into a high-definition data format that is verifiable, semantically structured, graph-based, and machine readable.
- **Decentralised Governance:** Implement decentralised governance with advanced DAO tooling and the ability to include both AI agents and humans in decision consensus.
- **Executable Deeds:** Manage requests, offers, and governance proposals that are executed with governance controls and built-in verification mechanisms.
- **Digital Rights Management:** Secure digital rights with object capabilities.
- **Client SDK:** Integrate with third-party applications effortlessly.
- **Mission Control:** Oversee and manage your networks of Impact Oracles.
- **Verifiable ML:** Employ zK Proofs for verifiable machine learning with Giza Protocol.
